# Embedded Intelligence
Great progress in microelectronics, wireless communication and sensor technology afford the application of intelligent IT-systems and their cross-linking in every work and life area today. Products with new, integrated applications and functions can assist humans in their activities and operations. Furthermore, the automated information exchange between intelligent, cross-linked systems  allows the increase of productivity and  the saving of ressources in production and work processes.

The research of the group “Embedded Intelligence” focusses on the development of innovative solutions in the field of cross-linked sensor-actuator-systems and energy-efficient systems.
